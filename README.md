# Compute_Progress
What is ?

# What

During my programming journey I will need some sort of scale, measurement of my current skill and progress.

Here will be all the small projects done as a test, to see how far I have come and how far I still need to go.
They may not be the most polished but done is better than perfect and that is what I will be aiming for.

For bigger and more ambitious projects, see portfolio at dev_stdout or LumenNoctis
